		<h3>About Myself</h3>
		<p>My name is Matthew Drapchaty, but I prefer go by Matt. I am 25 years old, currently living in San Jose, California, although I am moving to Colorado Springs, Colorado, this month and am quite excited about it. I am fairly new to web design and web development, with my first experiences being Full Sail. I feel that WDD is a perfect fit for me as it allows me to exercise critical and cognitive thinking, which is where I feel my mind works best, while still being able to express an artistic side, which is something I enjoy, but admittedly am not as naturally gifted in.   </p>

			<h2>Drop-Down Menu Header</h2>
			<h3>What I Hope To Practice/Learn?</h3>
			<p>Drop down navigation is something that is seen in almost any decent web desgin, although it is something I have done before, I hope to practice it and begin to feel more confident in using this component in my regular WDD use. </p>
			<h3>How This Relates To What I Have/Will Learn in WDD. </h3>
			<p>As I have said, this is a component that every good web devloper should be aware of, and is in fact something that has been taught throughout this degree program on a few occasions.</p>
			<h3>How I might Build This</h3>
			<ol>
				<li>Create component as &ltheader&gt. </li>
				<li>Establish company logo with &lth1&gt or &ltimg&gt.</li>
				<li>&ltnav&gt containing &ltul&gt with multiple &ltli&gt, each containing &lta&gt.</li>
				<li>Dropdown items will be a &ltul&gt inside of the corresponding &ltli&gt. </li>
				<li>Each &ltul&gt that drops down will contain multipl &ltli&gt, each with &lta&gt.</li>
			</ol>

			<h2>Results with Count-up numbers</h2>
			<h3>What I Hope To Practice/Learn?</h3>
			<p>Showing some company statistic results, with a cool animated number counting up feature. This is a new feature to me, and something I have not seen before, however I can assume that .animate is being used to case the numbers to go up upon scrolling onto the conent. I hope to learn not only how to get the numbers to animate correctly, but also how to set that to trigger upon becoming visible to the user.</p>
			<h3>How This Relates To What I Have/Will Learn in WDD. </h3>
			<p>This relates to WDD because it is using development methods such as .animate, again I am asuming, and draws a great deal of attention from the user to this component by doing so. Learning a multitude of tricks like this is what I believe will take my web designs from ordinary to extraordinary.  </p>
			<h3>How I might Build This</h3>
			<ol>
				<li>Create 4 &ltdiv&gt each with &lth3&gt and &ltp&gt inside.</li>
				<li>Each &ltdiv&gt will also contain an icon &ltimg&gt and a number.</li>
				<li>use .animate to get the number to count upwards towards the target number, over a set time, upon scrolling upon the &ltdiv&gt.</li>
				
			</ol>

			<h2>Latest News with Image Slide</h2>
			<h3>What I Hope To Practice/Learn?</h3>
			<p>Demonstrating the latest news with images with captions. This component looks fantastic and will help me master .animate with positioning, direction, and timing. The img's are also links and have a :hover affect which looks really great and brings an overlay with an icon over the img. This is something that is very new and unfamiliar to me and will be a great asset in my WDD arsenal, especially learning the code to make it work as opposed to using an external js library. </p>
			<h3>How This Relates To What I Have/Will Learn in WDD. </h3>
			<p>This relates to what i will be learning in my WDD program because it is something that looks sharp and grabs attention. It is also more advanced than just having images and reguires some use of .animate and the know how to make it move in the intended directions and end up in a coordianted stylish way. </p>
			<h3>How I might Build This</h3>
			<ol>
				<li>Use a &lth3&gt to create a title.</li>
				<li>Create several &ltimg&gt that contain &lta&gt.</li>
				<li>Create a a:hover affect for each img so that upon hover an overlay and icon appear.</li>
				<li>Use .animate or .slide to get these &ltimg&gt to slide into a position form multiple different directions over a set time.</li>

			<h2>About our Company with Animated Button</h2>
			<h3>What I Hope To Practice/Learn?</h3>
			<p> A few bullet points to emphasize what the company is about. The button is also a :hover and .animate effect. These seem to be the most appealing to the eye, and again this is something I have seen, but have not exactly practiced or used before. I have used :hover effects on buttons, but not with an animated slide or transition like is present here. I suspect this component may be a combination of css transition and javascript .animate. I think it will look nice and help me tackle button animation head on to be able to make impressive buttons with ease. </p>
			<h3>How This Relates To What I Have/Will Learn in WDD. </h3>
			<p>This is a very standard component( button ) , that is made much more appealing. Most websites contain buttons, and adding a :hover effect to demonstrate that a component is clickable is key for users to fully understand what they are working with. This is something I will use throughout the rest of my WDD program as well as in most if not all future websites I will be creating.</p>
			<h3>How I might Build This</h3>
			<ol>
				<li>Create an html &ltbutton&gt next to a corresponding form or CTA.</li>
				<li>Label &ltbutton&gt with an approprite action on it (verb) so the user know what action he or she will take upon clicking it.</li>
				<li>Using css transition property and or :hover, possibly in combination with javascript/jquery .animate/.slide methods to create this effect.</li>
				
			</ol>

			<h2>Testimonial Carousel(Featured)</h2>
			<h3>What I Hope To Practice/Learn?</h3>
			<p>The accordion is something I have used before, but is new and I don't have a very strong understanding of it yet. This month I hope to strengthen that understanding immensely. I also hope to learn how to get the accordion to cycle through the 'tabs' on its own on a timer, while getting the dot links below to change to illustrate which tab is currently being veiwed</p>
			<h3>How This Relates To What I Have/Will Learn in WDD. </h3>
			<p>This is a great way to demonstrate a product/service by showing what customers have said about our product/work. This will be useful in real world WDD and looks great. It utilizes Javascript to auto scroll through testimonials by showing/hiding them on a set time. This directly relates to a lot of work I have been doing using javascript thus far by connecting each 'div' to show upon clicking a link at the bottom, or to show by scrolling by a set timer.</p>

			<h3>How I might Build This</h3>
			<ol>
				<li>Create a &ltsection&gt with a &lth3&gt</li>
				<li>&ltp&gt to give some context to what the viewer is seeing</li>
				<li>Create 3 &ltdiv&gt that will represent each 'tab' that will be cycled through. each with a &ltimg&gt, &lth3&gt, and &ltp&gt</li>
				<li>Using Javascript/Jquery create an accordion that will cyle through the 3 &ltdiv&gt, with .hide/.show  </li>
				<li>Create 3 links that are circle icons, each one corresponding to one of the &ltdiv&gt, and animating to show which one is currently active.</li>
			</ol>
